As a student of Cyber Security at [FAST NUCES](https://www.nu.edu.pk/), I successfully completed my first programming course, Programming Fundamentals, with an outstanding grade of A+. Throughout the course, we primarily focused on coding in C++. Attached are the assignments that were assigned to us, which I have solved.


## ðŸ—“ Assignments 
- [Assignment 1](https://github.com/mrblackhearts/programming-fundamentals-cs1002-assignments/tree/main/assignment1) Basic Input/Output and Arithmetic Operators
- [Assignment 2](https://github.com/mrblackhearts/programming-fundamentals-cs1002-assignments/tree/main/assignment2) Logic Development : if-else-if and switches
- [Assignment 3](https://github.com/mrblackhearts/programming-fundamentals-cs1002-assignments/tree/main/assignment3) Pattern Printing Using Loops
- [Assignment 4](https://github.com/mrblackhearts/programming-fundamentals-cs1002-assignments/tree/main/assignment4) Functions 


## âš™ Languages and Concepts Covered
- C++ programming language
- Variable declaration and utilization
- Assignment, arithmetic, bitwise and logical operators
- Conditional statements: if, else, else if
- Multiple selection structure: switch statement
- Looping constructs: for, while, do/while
- Control flow manipulation: break and continue statements
- Function definition and usage
- Arrays for data organization
- Pointers for memory management
- String manipulation and processing
- Output formatting using iomanip library
- Dynamic memory allocation with dynamic arrays
- File reading and writing using fstream library

These topics were covered extensively throughout the course, providing me with a solid foundation in programming fundamentals and practical skills in C++ programming.
